## Get a login account

A user with a `  jasmin -login` account is allocated a HOME directory of
**100GB** and can access the shared JASMIN servers (Scientific servers, data
transfer servers,  and  LOTUS). Sign in into your [JASMIN accounts
portal](https://accounts.jasmin.ac.uk/) where you can apply for a JASMIN login
account representing the JASMIN access role appropriate to your affiliation.
